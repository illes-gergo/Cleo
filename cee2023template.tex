Terahertz generation in nonlinear media is known to be a widely used way to generate single cycle terahertz pulses with great efficiency. Using high pumping intensity in semiconducting materials at the close infrared region is not feasable due to the high multiphoton absorption. \cite{polonyi2016high} As of now, carpon\hyp{}dioxide lasers with sub-picosecond pulse durations are available \cite{polyanskiy2020demonstration}, which can eliminate low-order multiphoton absorption since their central wavelength is approximetly 10 \textmu m.

Numeric 1D+1 calculations were used with pulse durations between 0.5\hyp{}2.5 ps and intensities from 20\hyp{} to 100 GW/cm$^2$ for investigation. The model took account for the optical rectification, cascading up\hyp{} and downconversion of pump pulse, the self phase modulation of pump pulse \cite{ravi2014limitations} and the second harmonic generated by the pump pulse. The inclusion of second-harmonic generation (SHG) is very important since it can reduce the THz conversion efficiency by up to 50\%. The nonlinear media was chosen to be Gallium-Arsenide (GaAs). The result with 1.5 ps pulse duration and 60 GW/cm$^2$ pumping intensity is shown on {Fig.\ref{fig1}}.

%Please be concise in your presentation, highlighting what is novel and
%original about your submission. \textbf{Do not repeat the separate 35
%word abstract.} Simple equations should be included in-line wherever
%possible, whereas more complex expressions should be centred and
%numbered if there are several. Figures should be relevant to the
%submission and preferably centred as shown below. They should be
%placed as close as possible to where they are mentioned in the text.
%Placing subfigures side-by-side is a convenient way to include
%multiple results within the one-page limit. The figures can be
%provided in greyscale or colours. Figure captions should be centred
%beneath figures and in an 8-point font. Figure captions should be
%indented 1 cm on both sides and justified on both right and left
%sides.

The results show that carbon\hyp{}dioxide pumped GaAs crystal is capable of generating THz pulses with adequate efficiency and field strength. At 3 mm crystal length the shape of the THz pulse is usable for most applications that require single-cycle THz pulses. The efficiency at 3 mm is 0.1\% and the peak field strength is 200 kV/cm and by focusing 10 MV/cm peak field strength is achievable \cite{Tibai:22}. At 5 mm crystal length the conversion efficiency further increases to 0.9\% however the THz pulse becomes highly modulated.
